# Bow and Arrows

This project includes a simple firing range and a test bow.

The main interest was developing an aerodynamic drag based physics model to allow non-trivial trajectories, adjustable bows; draw weight (N) and draw length (m). It also allowed the use of collision detection and re-parenting of the arrows.

Most of the code is quite trivial, but some details will be described here in the wiki.
